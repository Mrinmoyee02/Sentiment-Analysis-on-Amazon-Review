# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Amazon-Review
OBJECTIVE 

The objective of this project is to develop a robust model for mutomated sentiment classification of Amazon reviews into positive or negative categories.

ABSTRACT

In this project:

Data Exploration: We ensured a balanced dataset with equal numbers of positive and negative reviews and gained insights into review lengths. A

Data Preprocessing: We preprocessed a sample of 10,000 reviews by removing special characters, digits, punctuation, and stop words, and converting text to lowercase.

* Feature Engineering: Numerical features were generated using CountVectorizer to enhance the modeling process.

* Modeling: Various algorithms including Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and BERT (Transformer-based model) were implemented and evaluated.

* Model Evaluation: Performance metrics such as ROC-AUC score and accuracy were used to compare and identify the best-performing model for sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews.

This project's outcomes provide valuable insights and recommendations for selecting an optimal model for similar sentiment analysis tasks.
